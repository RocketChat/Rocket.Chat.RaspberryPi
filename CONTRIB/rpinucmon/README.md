<h1>RocketPi + I7NUC WITH OPEN-SOURCE MONITORING</h1>
<br/>This was designed to stick a NUC and a Raspberry Pi in the same chassis with hardware monitoring and Rocket.Chat

<br/><b>Basic Project Requirements:</b>
<br/>- Windows 10 machine to run NVR software
<br/>- Webhosting
<br/>- Lightweight small DB
<br/>- Headless
<br/>- Visible hardware monitoring
<br/>- Single power supply
<br/>- Heat dissipation without added weight
<br/>- Custom mini-cab

<br/>Since my COVID-19 hobby became 3D printing...I decided to go a little ape and print everything to my own design so it is all self contained.

<br/><b>All items were printed using the following:</b>

<br/>- QIDI X-PLUS (with turbo-blower mod)
<br/>- MICRO-SWISS MK10 Plated Wear Resistant Nozzle
<br/>- Hatchbox Gold ABS 1.75mm filament
<br/>- Extruder temp: 220℃ for all layers
<br/>- Bed temp: 110℃ for the first 7 layers; 100℃ for all remaining layers

<br/>The parts used are as follows:
<br/>1x NUC5i7RYH (disassembled down to motherboard)
<br/>1x 8GB DDR3-12800 SO-DIMM
<br/>1x M.2 2280 PCIe 1TB NVMe SSD
<br/>1x NUC5i7RYH power brick (19vDC 3.42A)
<br/>1x Raspberry Pi 3B+ (overclocked)
<br/>1x WaveShare 5" HDMI LCD
<br/>1x Noctua NF-A12x15 FLX 120mm fan
<br/>1x KeyStone CAT6 RJ45 coupler
<br/>1x 9-36vDC to 5vDC@5A step down transformer ("Buck Converter")
<br/>1x 6" IDE 40-Pin Male to Female Extension Cable
<br/>1x 5.5x2.1mm 'Y' splitter - Female input; male outputs
<br/>1x 5.5x2.1mm Female Jack to 5.5x2.5mm Male Plug
<br/>1x 12-24vDC 16mm Pushbutton Switch
<br/>1x 6" HDMI cable
<br/>1x 6" CAT6 cable
<br/>1x Female 5.5x2.1mm DC Power Jack (threaded)
<br/>16x 10-32x1/2" hex head rack bolts (side plates)
<br/>8x 12-24x1/2" hex head rack bolts (top and bottom plates)
